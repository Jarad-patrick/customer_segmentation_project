Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. The goal is to uncover meaningful customer groups that can help businesses improve marketing strategies, personalize offers, and understand spending patterns.

 Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a common unsupervised learning task used in marketing analytics.
In this project, we:

Load and explore a customer dataset (Age, Annual Income, Spending Score, etc.)

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Apply K-Means clustering

Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method

Visualize clusters and centroids

Provide insights about each customer segment

This project demonstrates practical machine learning skills and is great for beginners learning clustering and unsupervised learning.
